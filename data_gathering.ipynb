    "**Problem Description**: The goal of this project to create a indoor localization estimator based on KNN using Wifi Signal Strength data derived from [this dataset of the universitiy of mannheim](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/crawdad-mannheimcompass-v-2006-09-13). In this dataset, the system estimates the position of mobile devices using RSS values collected from nearby access points. The task of the indoor localization estimator is to estimate the X, Y coordinates of a device as well as the degree.\n",
